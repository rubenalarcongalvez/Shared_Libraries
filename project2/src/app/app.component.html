<h1>Hello there! I'm using Angular</h1>

<p>The shared background is orangered, but I could change it to blue. However, I did not modify the font color in my project but in the shared styles.</p>
<code>As you can see, the global styles are shared with Symbolic Links. I can always edit the project style using the <b>!important</b> property.</code>
